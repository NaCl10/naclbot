# NaClbot

This is my bad Discord bot. It doesn't do much, I mostly just made it to learn about making Discord bots and because I could.

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NaCl10/naclbot
```

Run main.py:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

Edit config.ini (which the script just generated) to contain your bot token. More info about getting a bot token can be found on [the only good part of the discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#discord-intro).

Then run main.py again to actually start the bot this time. It is reccomended to use some way of autostarting the bot script (and also to run it on a machine that will have high uptime, like a server).
